## Curve Data

Rules of Curve Data:
 - Draw lines on the grid from cell center to cell center, forming shapes.
 - Each cell must be used by exactly one shape.
 - Each shape covers exactly one clue in the grid; this draws the shape that covers it. The segments of this drawing are in the correct directions, but each of them may be extended or contracted any amount.
