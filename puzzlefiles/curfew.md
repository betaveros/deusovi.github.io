## Unequal Curfew

Curfew is a genre invented by Hempuli; I made a slight modification to give this variant. 

Rules of Unequal Curfew:

 - Draw a loop that visits every circle.
 - Each visit to a room must be the same length.
 - A room's number tells the length of each visit to that room.
 - The loop cannot make a visit of the same length twice in a row.
