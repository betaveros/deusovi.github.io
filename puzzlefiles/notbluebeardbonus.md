Congratulations!

As mentioned in the puzzle itself, this is `PART ONE` of a set of four puzzles. It is based on the story of the Night ∞ Series, a set of four Vocaloid songs (and associated music videos). In it, several actors repeatedly act out the same play, which goes horribly wrong each time. [(Link to videos)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r4WZjD4Xbw)

Knowledge of the series might make the theming and puns a bit more enjoyable / gettable, but you do not need to know *anything* about it to solve the later puzzles. Feel free to skip it if you'd like! Or you can read the summary [here]( https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Night_%E2%88%9E_Series) and the plot descriptions linked on each page, if you want a quick overview.

[Content warning: as suggested by the first puzzle, the remainder of the songs have the same sort of "dark" tone. the videos use a "paper doll"-like art style, and no violent content is shown. The story is abstract/confusing enough that it will likely not have a harmful effect on any solvers. But I figured it was better to warn people just in case.]

[Additionally, there are a few slightly crude references in the upcoming puzzles. Solve at your own discretion.]

As before, feel free to contact me for hints or feedback - always happy to hear from people solving my puzzles. hope you enjoy!
