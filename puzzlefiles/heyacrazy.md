## Heyacrazy

This genre is an original invention based off of Heyawake. If you're already familiar with the rules of Heyawawke, this puzzle just extends them to lines that are not horizontal or vertical.

Rules of Heyacrazy:
 - Shade some cells in the grid.
 - Shaded cells may not be adjacent (but may touch at a corner).
 - Unshaded cells must form a single connected group.
 - It must not be possible to draw a line on the grid that passes through only unshaded cells, crosses two walls, and does not pass through any vertices.

**Isometric Heyacrazy: Diode** -- in this puzzle, the grid is actually a folded surface. "Straight lines" are those that would be straight when that section of the grid is unfolded.

**Heyacrazier: Big Three** -- in this puzzle, the rule about "crossing two walls" instead bans lines that cross *three* walls.

**Toroidal Heyacrazy: Rainstorm** -- in this puzzle, the grid wraps around. The red lines mark the point where this happens, but otherwise have no effect. Nine copies of the grid are provided for your convenience.
