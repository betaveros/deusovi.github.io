## Pentominous

Rules of Pentominous:
 - Dissect the grid into pentominoes.
 - Adjacent pentominoes cannot be the same shape (but those touching at a corner can). Rotations and reflections are counted as the same shape.
 - The 12 possible pentomino shapes are labelled with the standard letters. A letter in a cell must correctly label the shape it is in. (Shapes can have any number of letters, including none at all.)
