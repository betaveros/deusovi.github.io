# Logic Puzzles

I enjoy Nikoli-style logic puzzles -- visual logic puzzles meant to be solved by pure deduction, where no guessing is necessary. If you're new to these, Pavel Curtis (as "Ada Lovelace") has written some [advice](http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas/advice.htm) that's very helpful.
