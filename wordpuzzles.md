# Word Puzzles

I've made several cryptic crosswords in the past, inspired largely by the work of [Ucaoimhu](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~wald/). These cryptics are generally not very easy - feel free to contact me for hints or feedback!

A few of these puzzles have some inside references in them; a ★ has an explanation of the references (with spoilers!)



[**Not Bluebeard's Castle**](puzzlefiles/notbluebeard/not_bluebeard.pdf) (4 Jan 2021): A puzzle that references Bartók's [Bluebeard's Castle](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c90dmd68vu6hjcq/Bluebeards_Castle_Rew.pdf?dl=0), but has something deeper going on... No knowledge of Bartók's puzzle is required to solve this. When you've finished the puzzle, there's some [**bonus content**](puzzlefiles/notbluebeardbonus.md) too!

[**Going Up!**](puzzlefiles/goingup.pdf) (8 Nov 2019): A puzzle written for an important event for a good friend. ([★](puzzlefiles/goingup-explanation.md))

[**Arc (&) Reactors**](puzzlefiles/arcandreactor.pdf) (13 Apr 2019): Written as a send-off to a work of fiction I enjoyed. Not very accessible for solvers unfamiliar with the work of fiction. If you're still interested in solving, the information you'll need is [here](puzzlefiles/arcandreactor-info.md).

[**Strange Decorations**](puzzlefiles/strangedecorations.pdf) (25 Dec 2018): Written for a Secret Santa puzzle exchange. ([★](puzzlefiles/strangedecorations-explanation.md))
